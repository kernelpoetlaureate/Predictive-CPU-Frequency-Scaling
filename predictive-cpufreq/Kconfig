	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	  This governor implements a predictive CPU frequency scaling
	  algorithm that anticipates workload changes rather than just
	  reacting to them. It uses historical data and pattern
	  recognition to predict future CPU utilization and adjust
	  frequencies proactively.
	  
	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called predictive-cpufreq.
	  
	  If in doubt, say N.
